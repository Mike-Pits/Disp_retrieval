# Disp_retrieval
This script is intended to retrieve emails from MS Outlook folders for further processing and analyzing.
In particular the script will be collecting daily reports from cargo ships. The reports contain
GPS psoitions at certain time, miles covered for last 24 hours, average speed, fuels consumed, fuels stocks remaining on board,
ETA next destination or a way-point, sea/wind/ice conditions etc.
These data will further be stored, pre-processed and analyzed for final submiting graphical results at a dash-board.

The initial script is borrowed from Sven-Bo with huge thanks (https://pythonandvba.com/). It then adapted to my particular circuymstances and conditions.
